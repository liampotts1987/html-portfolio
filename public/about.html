<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a senior business intelligence analyst who enjoys building and visualising reports. I have recently began training 
  myself in web development. This was due to a task presented to me for filtering multiple Power BI reports. We discovered 
  we could embed the report within an iframe and apply url parameter filters within the iframe.

  I am engaged to my partner of 10 years and have a date set for our wedding. We have a wonderful son who is 3 years old 
  and I love spending time with my family. Whether that be at home or going away to places. We love watching films together 
  hence the movie ranking project.

  I enjoy watching football and support Manchester United. I enjoy console gaming and cooking. Especially when cooking with my family.
