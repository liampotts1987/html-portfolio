<h1>The Best Movies According to Liam</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Aliens</h3>

<p>This is my favourite film of all time. 
There are so many great quotes established from this 
film that can be referenced almost on a daily basis</p>

<h3>Scream</h3>

<p>The original slasher which spawned a whole genre and 
created the original take on spoof movies in the 
Scary Movie series</p>

<h3>Top Gun</h3>

<p>Top Gun is one of the films I remember most when growing up.
Tom Cruise is also one of my favourite actors of all time.
